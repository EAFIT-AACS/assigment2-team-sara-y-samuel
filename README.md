## 🔢Class Number🔢
- SI2002-2 (7309)

## 🛠️Systems and tools used🛠️
- Operative system: Windows 11 Pro and Windows 11 Home Single Language.
- Programming language: Python 3.11
- Tools used: Visual Studio Code.

## ✅Instruction for running✅
- Make sure you have Python installed.
- Save the code in a file named.
- Download the necessary Python extensions (especially if you use Visual Studio Code).
- Save all your files in the same folder, if you dont have a txt created in the folder, the code will create one where the valid and invalid strings are.


## 🖊️Explanation of the Algorithm🖊️
🧩 Algorithm 1: This code creates a text file (cadenas.txt), containing a list of valid and invalid strings for the PDA to process, it will generate valid and invalid strings made up of 'a' and 'b'.

🧩 Algorithm 2: Reads strings from cadenas.txt and checks if each string is accepted or rejected by a PDA.

🧩 Algorithm 3: For accepted strings, display each step (transition) the PDA takes — like a trace or tree.
